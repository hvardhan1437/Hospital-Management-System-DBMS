# 🏥 Hospital Management System – Mini Project (DBMS)
This mini-project was developed as part of our Database Management Systems (DBMS) coursework. The aim was to simulate a basic Hospital Management System using PostgreSQL as the backend database and Python (with psycopg2) for the interface layer. It covers fundamental CRUD operations for managing patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and administrative staff.

⚠️ Note: This project is in a preliminary stage and contains several known bugs. Future plans include fixing these issues, optimizing queries, and enhancing the user interface.



## 📁 Features (Implemented)
- Add and view patient records

- Add and manage doctor details

- Schedule and track appointments

- Simple billing functionality

- Basic user interface via command-line prompts

- Database schema creation and connection through psycopg2 (PostgreSQL)


## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Implement proper error handling and input validation

- Shift to a GUI-based interface (e.g., Tkinter or web-based using Flask)

- Use ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) for cleaner DB interactions

- Modularize the codebase and implement logging

- Add role-based authentication for admin/staff
